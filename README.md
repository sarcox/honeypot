# honeypot
CodePath Week 9 Write-up

For this assignment, I created several VM's using the AWS infastructure. Aside from the MHN ADmin VM, each VM was named after the type of honeypot it offered:
+ MHN Admin - ec2-54-183-118-170.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com - 54.183.118.170
+ Conpot -ec2-52-53-148-137.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com - 52.53.148.137
+ Dionaea - ec2-54-153-60-139.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com - 54.153.60.139
+ Suricata - ec2-54-241-191-4.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com - 54.241.191.4

#AWS Setup
The setup in AWS ran very smootly.  The free-tier AWS account offered te Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty) with the micro sizing.
